Project Website: https://zilixie.github.io/Relief-and-Normal-Mapping/

A 3D scene editor implemented in C++ using OpenGL that supports different types texture techinique: perlin noise, procedural bump, texture mapping, normal mapping, parallax mapping. Library used: Eigen, GLFW, SOIL. It also supports the basic functionalities of a 3D object editor: insert, tranlate, colorize, rotate, scale, animate, delete for triangle mesh objects in .OFF file format and it allows users to export scene into .svg files.

# Perlin Noise
What perlin noise does? Generate smooth pseudo noise given seed in 3D. What can it be used for? produce game scenes such as mountains, seas, clouds...
